# About Movie

The two major aspects of this application are the filter and the result.

- **The Filter:**
  The filter allows you to choose the **genres** that you want a movie to have. Along with that, it takes the rating mode (e.g., PG, PG-13, etc.). It also considers the range of release and three popular rating sources including Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Metacritic.

- **The Result**
  You then search for a movie and it shows you whether or not the movie has passed the filtering.
